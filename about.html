## About

I am crafting software since I was 10. Starting to learn programming while other were discovering the NES, I have never stop since them.
Today, I design and code software for various companies with quality of code, maintability and simplicity in mind.
Living in Lausanne, Switzerland, I love to go skiing in the Swiss montains when I have time !
