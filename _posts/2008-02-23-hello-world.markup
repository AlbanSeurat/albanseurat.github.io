Hi all, i’m french and i would like to share thought, experience about development.
I’m software architect and i’m working with several technologies i will certainly share with you.

I intend to publish several how-to based on my experience.
It’s always frustrating to make something without help.
It’s the first intent of this site.
If, sometimes i want to share some toughts (like the weather in south of France, i will do this also :) )

I’ve paid for 10 years of web hosting so fell free to track back any link you want.
